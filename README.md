The new functions I have learned:
1. constructor function 
2. push & pop function
3. map function 

New learning methods I have used:
1. asking chatgpt to explain snippets of code when I am completely lost
2. read the code back & forth (unlike reading a novel, where one can just keep on reading without skipping or constantly looking back)

Other works I found on OpenProcessing.org that have inspired me:
